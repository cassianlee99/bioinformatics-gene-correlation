\# Synthetic Gene Expression Correlation Analysis



\## Overview

This project demonstrates gene expression data analysis using Python. 

It includes computation of gene-to-gene correlations and visualisation with a heatmap.



The dataset used is synthetic, designed to illustrate bioinformatics workflows for portfolio purposes.



\## Skills Demonstrated

\- Python programming

\- Data manipulation with Pandas

\- Visualisation with Seaborn and Matplotlib

\- Generating and handling CSV datasets

\- Version control with Git/GitHub
